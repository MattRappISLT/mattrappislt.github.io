<h1> Matt Rapp's Design Document </h1>

<h2> Purpose </h2>

<p> This website serves as a hub for all of the content I create. My blog posts and video content will be on this website. </p>

<h2> User Case </h2>

<p> The user of this website is intended to be potential people that are interested in having me work for them, so they can see a portfolio of my past work. Also, potentially people who want to read 
opinion pieces about movies or television. The third user case would be, my family and friends that I direct to the website to show off my work. </p> 

<h2> Questionaire </h2>
<p> I interviewed five people, one someone I know who I am potentially going to be working for after I graduate in the spring, and the other four being a mixture of friends and family. 
The questions I asked them are, what do they most dislike in a website, or, what about a website makes it the most annoying to navigate? I also asked how many pages they think a website should be divided into, and 
should I focus on simplicity in design or make it flashy and eye popping? </p>
<p> Everybody wanted a simple website that isn't an eye sore, not a ton of colors and no colors that clash. I would personally agree with that so it was good to know that my vision of the website is in line with
what everyone else was thinking. They said that the website should not be cluttered, everything should be divided neatly into seperate pages. Thankfully, my website will not contain much other than blog posts
and videos, which will either be embedded or more than likely links. They said a cluttered website or one that is filled with advertisements makes it the most annoying. Thankfully I will not have to worry about
advertisements. 

<h2> Design Concept </h2> 

<h3> Audience </h3>

<p> As stated above, the audience is primarily employers but also curious readers looking for blog posts. </p>

<h3> Reference Websites </h3>

<h2> Present Information </h2>
<h3> Content Synoposis </h3>
<p> The website will load to a home page, which will give a short introduction to who I am, potentially with a graphic that is a picture of me. There will be two tabs, one leading to blogs, one leading to videos.</p>

<h3> Rationale for Organizatoin </h3>
<p> I want my website to be as simple and easy to use as possible. There are two main areas of the website, the blogs and videos, so those are the two pages and the option to go to those pages will be right there.
I see no need to overcomplicate things and I want people to be able to easily access my stuff. My content should be the star. </p>

<h3> WireFrame</h3>

<h3> Color Scheme </h3>
<p> The most important thing about colors is that they should be, in my opinion, simple and easy to look at. Should not clash or be a distraction. I am choosing to go with <font color="blue">blue</font> and
<font color="silver">silver</font> . </p>
