<h1>My H1 Is My Title</h1>

<p>Hello Class! My name is Matt. This is a block surrounded by paragraph tags. Paragraphs are block level element.</p>

<p> However, some tags are inline, meaning that they don't create a new block of text, but theys state that there is a meaning change. For example, <b> this text is emphasized by making it bold </b> . Sometimes we 
may choose to emphasize other text by <i> italicizing it </i> or <u> underlining it </u> . </p> 

<h2> My lists. This is an H2 header. It is a subheading underneath H1. </h2>

<h3> Unordered lists </h3>
<p> We can also make lists. Here is an example of a bulleted (unordered) grocery list </p>
<ul>
<li> Apples </li>
<li> Milk </li>
<li> Cereal </li>
<li> Lettuce <li>
</ul>

<h3> Ordered lists (h3 heading) </h3>
<p> Or sometimes, I want to make a list, but it is numbered (ordered) instead. For example, the first three things I need to do today, in order are: </p>
<ol>
<li> Brush teeth </li>
<li> Eat breakfast </li>
<li> Take child to preschool </li>
</ol>

<h2> Links (H2 heading) </h2>
<p> I can also link different things. For example, I can go to google.com by going to <a href="http://google.com">http://google.com</a> This is an absolute link because it has the entire URL file listed there.
If I were to link something locally on my server relative to this file, it would be a relative link. But we'll link to that type of page next time. </p>

<h2> Inline styling with colors (h2 heading) </h2>
<p> I can also color text using inline styling, but for the most part it is really best to use styling that is done in the header or using an external stylesheet. But we will worry about doing that
next time. Here I am making text <font color="green">green</font> <font color="red">red</font> and <font color="blue">blue</font> . It is really easy to insert a new color. There are lots of places to look for 
colors. You could go here color-hex.com, for example, <a href="www.color-hex.com">www.color-hex.com</a>

This is all for now. I made my first page! </p>
