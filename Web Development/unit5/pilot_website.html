<h2>AboutMe</h2>
<p>I'm a current college senior at the University of Missouri studying Digital Storytelling. With my degree, I hope to one day enter a career in video production, whether that be commercial,
  online advertising, film, television. I'm a dedicated movie and television addict. In the past, I have worked as a production assistant on local radio shows in Columbia Missouri and worked on online media
  for the Special Olympics of Missouri. This website is here so I can link you guys, the visitors of this website, to some of my work!
