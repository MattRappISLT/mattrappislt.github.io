<h1> Comparing and Contrasting CinemaBlend and GeekUniverse </h1>

<h2> Compare and Contrast </h2>
<p> The first website I am going to look at is https://www.cinemablend.com/ . 
I love movies, they are my passion and biggest hobby, and I would love to have a website I can share my opinions about movies 
on in the form of blog posts, along with a tab that leads to a portfolio of videos that I have made. I would love a dual-purpose website, so I can post vlogs and my 
own original videography work., http://www.geekuniverseshow.com/the-radio-show is the other website I am going to be comparing. Geek Universe is a local radio show, 
unlike cinemablend which is a national brand with a larger budget, but both center around pop culture content. While both websites cover the same kind of stuff, 
cinemablend features a lot of content from others, namely large movie studios, whereas Geek Universe focuses more on their own self made content. 
It is also clear that cinemablend was made by a team of more professional people, as the site is more sleek, less cluttered and overall much cleaner and higher quality looking. </p>

<h2> Strengths of CinemaBlend </h2>
<ol>
<li> Looks big budget, high production value </li>
<li> Clean, no clutter </li>
<li> Good user interface </li>
<li> Variety of content </li>
</ol>

<h2> CinemaBlend Weaknesses </h2> 
<ol> 
<li> Lack of personality in the website, no distinct voice </li>
<li> Content is more news related rather than original pieces of work or opinion pieces </li>
</ol>

<h2> Strengths of Geek Universe </h2>
<ol>
<li> Unique, distinct look </li>
<li> Has a voice </li>
<li> Original content </li>
</ol>

<h2> Weaknesses of Geek Universe </h2>
<ol>
<li> The website is cluttered </li>
<li> Background is hard to read with text. Hard on eyes. </li>
<li> So much stuff thrown together on the home page. Should be spread out and spread across multiple tabs. </li>
<li> White logo does not look good </li>
</ol>

<h2> Case 1 </h2>
<p> My website would hopefully have blog posts that would attract viewers that would want to read it. 
It would be great to grow some sort of small audience of people that like what I have to say about pop culture topics. It would also be a sort-of lure for people to 
get into watching the videos I upload to the website. </p>

<h2>Case 2</h2>
<p> My website will contain links and videos of the work I have filmed and edited to myself. Potentially, if I pursue a job that will use those skills, 
I could link my website to employers and that would be the portfolio that is necessary for a lot of jobs. My videos and blog posts could coexist and have a mutually beneficial relationship with each other.
 I would have people there to browse recreationally, and people to use it professionally when they are interested in employing me. </p>
