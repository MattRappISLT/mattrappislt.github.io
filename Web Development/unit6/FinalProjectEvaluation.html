<h1> Pilot Website Evaluation - Matt Rapp </h1>

<h2> Evaluator Summaries </h2>
<h3> Evaluator 1 </h3>
<p> Evaluator number 1 is Davis. Davis is my roommate and one of my best friends, 
so he was easy to recruit for help for this project. Davis spends most of his freetime in 
his room reading websites like Screenjunkies and WhatCulture, which are websites I would 
model my dream website after. He did it on Windows 10 using Google Chrome. The evaluator 
said that I had a lot of potential in this website, but it has not really came together yet, 
which is fair as a good bit of the coding still needs to be done and I had a lot of bugs that 
needed to be worked out. He gave the website generally 2’s and 3’s, which is fair, because the 
website is not finished. He does support the user base as he represents the casual user that would 
stumble upon the website. </p>

<h3> Evaluator 2 </h3>
<p> 
Evaluator number 2 is Seth. Seth is a friend of mine who meets a lot of the same criteria as Davis. 
He shares similar interests and looks at similar websites, and in his Journalism program he has a 
decent amount of experience writing websites as well so I thought he would be a good resource. 
He did it using google chrome on the newest Mac OS. He had similar criticisms as Davis, and gave 
the website 2’s. I think he was too nice to say 1. He represents the same userbase as Davis. </p>

<h3> Evaluator 3 </h3>
<p> The third evaluator is Brent. Brent is close to my family and I am in talks to work for him after 
I graduate in the spring, helping to produce online content for one of his companies. He looked 
at the website using Windows 10, Microsoft Edge internet browser. He has all the same criticisms 
as the first two evaluators, which is fair because my website is not complete as of this point, 
and he gave me 1’s. He represents the userbase that would be a potential employer,  because he is a 
potential employer, and he would want to see the content I would make. Luckily he knows this is just a 
website I am working on that is incomplete for a class so showing it to him right not will not change 
potential hiring. </p>

<h2> Plans going forward </h2>
<p> My plan is to finish the website and make it what I desire it to be. 
I have a basic groundwork of what it is going to look like, but I need to go
 through and fix the HTML errors and then add the links to my work. There is still a 
 decent amount that needs to be done as I did not do a super complete version of the website 
 for my pilot site as I was experiencing some 
difficulties with the HTML. </p>

<h2> Response to Overall Feedback </h2>
<p> 
The evaluation process was overall very good, because I felt like I needed the honest 
feedback to kick it into gear and work harder on finishing the site. Although, I was aware 
of the problems I had, so nothing they said was particularly surprising. That being said, 
it’s never a bad thing to hear feedback. </p>
