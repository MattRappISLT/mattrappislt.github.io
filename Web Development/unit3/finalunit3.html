<p>Welcome to my basic webpage. On this page, I am going to practice some HTML skills in Unit 3 while talking about some things related to my final project, and why I am doing what I am doing.</p>

<h2 style="color:blue;">My portfolio</h2>

<p> I would like my project to serve as a portfolio that contains some of the videos I have shot and edited. I grew up an avid movie lover, it has always been a big passion of mine and I wanted to go into 
a career that would allow me to work on creating films. I chose Digital Storytelling because it would provide me with skills and experience I need to work in production. Through both classes and internships I have
been in, I have been able to create an okay amount of videos and I would like a central hub that I could link them all in. Below are some of my favorite genres of film. </p>
<ol>
        <li>Horror</li>
        <li>Sci Fi</li>
        <li>fantasy</li>
        <li>Westerns</li>
</ol>



<h2 style="color:blue;">My Blog</h2>

<p> I am a person who goes to the movies every weekend and I watch genereally at least one movie a day. I have a lot of thoughts about movies and I would love to be able to share them with people, I enjoy
talking about films greatly. I would like to be able to post blogs and opinion based short essays I have about movies that I have seen recently. Writing has also been a passion of mine for a long time, and I 
consider it another potential career path, so practice will never hurt. </p>

<p> I would like, perhaps down the road as my skills improve, for my website to resemble <a href="https://alexandersemanda.wordpress.com/>this</a>
